Mini project 2 - alcohol consumption in pregnancy and pregancy complications in ALSPAC

Author: Flo Martin

# Supervisors
Dr Luisa Zuccolo & Professor Abigail Fraser

# Rationale
It has been hypothesised that alcohol may play a role in placenta-associated syndromes, though the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Numerous studies have examined asscoations of maternal alcohol intake in pregnancy with birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery and stillbirth. Results of these studies are inconsistent which may be due to differences in study design, exposure definition and degree of adjustment for potential confounders. However, to the best of our knowledge the associations between maternal alcohol intake with the two most common pregnancy complications, namely hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) and gestational diabetes have not been examined.

# Aims & objectives
To examine the association of maternal alcohol intake in pregnancy with pregnancy complications in mothers of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children (ALSPAC) cohort, where detailed information on alcohol consumption before pregnancy and for each trimester of pregnancy is available.

# Methods
1. Review the literature on alcohol intake in pregnancy and pregnacy complications, as well as other relevant outcomes that could inform this work
2. Define relevant categories of exposure
3. Identify potential confounders and agree an analysis plan with supervisors 
4. Obtain relevant data from ALSPAC database/supervisors
5. Complete derivation of variables and analysis
6. Write up for publication
