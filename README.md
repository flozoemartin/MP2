Mini project 2 - alcohol consumption in pregnancy and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy using ALSPAC

Author: Flo Martin

Dr Luisa Zuccolo & Professor Abigail Fraser

# Rationale
Alcohol increases blood pressure, yet estimates of its associations with pre-eclampsia range from positive to negative. It has been shown that low-to-moderate alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of various placenta-associated complications, including placenta previa and abruption. For hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) however, the association with alcohol consumption is unclear. Some studies report a negative association but conclude that residual confounding is to blame for this finding, as opposed to a biological effect. Other studies have shown alcohol consumption during pregnancy to be associated with an increased risk of HDP and advise against drinking during pregnancy on this basis.

# Aims & objectives
To examine the association between maternal alcohol intake in pregnancy and HDP in mothers of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children (ALSPAC) cohort, where detailed information on alcohol consumption before pregnancy and for each trimester of pregnancy is available. We will estimate the association of maternal drinking during pregnancy with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, separately and jointly as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). We also use partnerâ€™s alcohol intake as a negative exposure to strengthen causal inference. 

# Methods
1. Review the literature on alcohol intake in pregnancy and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, encompassing gestational hypertension and preeclampsia that could inform this work
2. Define relevant categories of exposure
3. Identify potential confounders and agree an analysis plan with supervisors 
4. Obtain relevant data from ALSPAC database/supervisors
5. Complete derivation of variables and analysis
6. Write up for publication
